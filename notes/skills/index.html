### Paper abstract:
>We introduce two imputation techniques for spatio-
temporal traffic data: Singular Value Regression (SVR) based on
a matrix representation and Tensor Weight Regression (TWR).
We unify the two approaches under SATORIS, a novel low-rank
parameter estimation framework. SATORIS explicitly capitalizes
on the temporal invariance of singular vectors and the tensor
factors across closely observed data points, a unique observation
derived from empirical traffic data, to achieve unification. Using
real-world traffic dataset, we show that in terms of accuracy, our
techniques markedly surpass traditional baseline methods like
mean/median imputation, k-nearest-neighbour imputation under
various metrics like tensor completion score (TCS), root mean
square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Compared 
to more competitive methods like softimpute, our methods
are just as good for missing ratios under 70% and significantly
better for higher missing ratios. While recent deep learning
methods like Miracle and Gain perform great for low missing
percentages, they are outperformed by our methods at higher
missing percentages due to a lack of sufficient observations. Our
results indicate that when the missing data percentage is low, our
method performs as good as the state of the art methods and
is superior in performance with respect to various metrics for
higher missing percentages.
