# Evolution/Recommendation in teaching

LACSG in 1993 initiated significant recommendations that raised awareness about the importance of the first course in linear algebra.

New technologies becoming available for teaching and learning purposes (PYTHON/YOUTUBE/MANIM/NUMPY), making technology more accessible and affordable for students.

Industry experts suggest a single semester course may not cover all essential topics, recommending quantitative analysis or STEM careers take at least two courses to gain a deeper understanding of the subject

Proof writing through linear algebra help individuals in industry assess the validity of algorithms and ideas, work with abstract variables, and understand system components' contributions to behavior

Industry experts support a review of the mathematical curriculum and role of linear algebra in the broader scheme, emphasizing importance of integrating linear algebra into STEM fields for a strong theoretical and computational foundation
---

# Role of technology

Making resources more accessible and affordable for students, enabling them to engage with the subject more effectively

Providing tools for visualization, computation, and exploration of linear algebraic concepts, enhancing understanding and retention of abstract mathematical ideas

Allowing for interactive learning experiences, simulations, and real-world applications that motivate students and provide insights into the practical relevance of linear algebra in various fields

Facilitating the integration of modern applications and technologies into the curriculum, aligning teaching methods with the demands of a quantitatively driven world and preparing students for careers in data science, signal processing, cryptography, computer science, and quantum computing

Supporting the development of critical thinking skills through hands-on activities, problem-solving tasks, and collaborative projects that deepen students' understanding of linear algebraic concepts and their applications in STEM disciplines
---

# Skills Gap and topics/concepts for bridging

Abstract vector spaces, subspaces, linear independence, span, bases, and dimension in the context of abstract vector spaces to provide a foundational understanding of vector space theory and its applications

Linear maps between vector spaces, null space, range of a linear map, matrix representation of linear maps, rank, and nullity of matrices to facilitate the study of linear transformations and their properties

Invertibility of matrices and linear maps to explore the concepts of invertible transformations, isomorphisms, and their implications in various mathematical and applied contexts

Geometric and algebraic multiplicity, generalized eigenvectors, Jordan form, minimal polynomial, characteristic polynomial, diagonalizability, determinant, trace, and tensors to delve into advanced topics in linear algebra, providing a comprehensive understanding of eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and their applications in diverse fields

Integration of numerical linear algebra topics within a specific software context to bridge theoretical concepts with practical implementations, catering to the needs of students pursuing applied disciplines and enhancing their computational skills and problem-solving abilities
---

# New Recommendations
Teaching linear algebra sooner in the curriculum, 

removing calculus as a prerequisite,

considering the needs of industry, 

being aware of the latest research in linear algebra education,
 
taking advantage of technology in teaching, motivating concepts with applications, and

developing second courses in linear algebra.

---

# Conclusions

Although calculus is currently the mathematical starting
point for almost all STEM students, much of the mathematics currently used in industry has its foundation in linear
algebra. Offering linear algebra to incoming freshmen,
with a second course offered to juniors or seniors, would
benefit students who will use linear algebraic ideas in their
careers and elsewhere in their studies
