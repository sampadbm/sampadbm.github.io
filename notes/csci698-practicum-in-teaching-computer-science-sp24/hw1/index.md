## Teaching roles and responsibilities

Checklist
I am TAing for CSCI567 - Machine Learning with Prof. Vatsal Sharan this Spring 2024.
We have a slack group for the TAs and mostly communicate with email, then slack
and then celphone numberds for emergency, especially during exams.
There is only one class each Friday from 1pm to 3:20pm and the discussion
sessions are held from 3:30pm till 4:30pm.
This is my second time TAing this course with Prof. Vatsal, the first being in Fall 2022.
- Discussion
I am incharge of leading the Linear Algebra 1 and 2 discussions which serve
as a revision for the students as it is not only a prerequisite for the
course but also is key to success in this class. Apart from that I will be leading
the midterm1 and midterm2 exam review discusssions via mock exam question sets. 
- Homework
I am not incharge of creating any questions for any of the four homeworks for this semester. 
I was in Fall2022 though which was tough as it was the first time Vatsal was teaching it and we had to create a lot of homework questions/materials from scratch
- Grading
All TAs are responsible for grading the midterm 1 and midterm 2 answers
- Office Hours
All TAs hold office hours of atleast 2 hours each week and my office hours
are from 10am to 12am every Thursday.
- Other Responsibilities
I am incharge of setting up gradescope/crowdmark for the exams, printing of the questions via DEN,
uploading the scans on gradescope/crowdmark and making sure the exam answer scans are ready for grading by the TAs

• Do I understand the professor’ s methods for the course?
Yes, having interacted with Prof. Vatsal on many occassions, I luckily share
a lot of his philosophies about teaching and he wants to strike a good balance
between rigour in theory and hands on practice in machine learning to make the
homeworks and exams an enjoyable experience. He puts a lot of thoughts and effort
into designing the homeworks and the exams. He deeply cares about his students with regard
to learning and is kind and accomodating towards them whenever possible.

All the instruction materials for this class are/will be made available on the 
course website [CSCI567 Spring2024](https://vatsalsharan.github.io/spring24.html)
