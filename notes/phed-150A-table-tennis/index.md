### Snake Serve

I watched this [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q1poA30eT84) on fake serve -

Generally to put underspin on the ball, we have to hit it under the ball. To create top spin we have to brush and racket with the ball while we are moving the racket upwards.

In this fake serve, we through the ball high up and use the kinetic energy of the ball while falling to create a top spin by tilting the racket backward. However, after the ball has touched the racket, immediately we make a undersping after motion to disguise the true spin on the ball. This confuses/misleads/surprises the opponent and maybe makes them not be able to return the serve. 

This serve is tricky. We have to have the after-motion immediately after the ball hits the tilted racket so that the after-motion is smooth and consistent to be able to fool the opponent. Initially we need to practice to create the top-spin itself without caring about the delay between the actual contact of the ball with the racket and the after-motion. However, after we have perfected our top spin using the racket tilt method, we can then focus on making the underspin after-motion seem fluid and consistent to happen at the same time as the contact of ball with the racket to trick the opponent.

I will be trying to learn this snake serve in the upcoming classes.
