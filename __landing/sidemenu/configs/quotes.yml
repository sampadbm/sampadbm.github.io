        - "It is important that students bring a certain rafamuffin, barefoot, irreverence to their studies; they are not here to worship what is known, but to question it"

        - The knowledge of certain principles easily compensates the lack of knowledge of certain facts [1759].

Teo Swee Ann: 
        - Excelling in everything at school is not the goal; doing well in subjects that interest them (his kids) is good enough
