title: Paper Flowers movie screening @ USC
summary: Went to the screening of the moving movie called paper flowers. It was based on the viral post called "Thank you, Cancer" which is a post that went viral in the mid 2010s. The story is a real life event based on two students from USC who were in love with each other. The actors in the movie were also from USC and one of them is USC alumnus Karan Soni who also starred in Deadpool. I took this picture with him. Karan gave great advise to me when I asked I wanted to pursue some story writing and acting. He asked me if I had a car and then I could just go around to auditions or take classes from UCLA extension school for writing which is affordable. The lead actress Olivia (she is Taiwanese, revealed during the QnA session after the movie, Karan is from Delhi) said "go get her !!" when I said Karan pointed out to her that I had a similar experience as the movie with regards to the Indian parents objecting to the lead characters relationship.
