# Introduction 
All of us are familiar with numbers. Numbers, when interpreted as on a real line, represent the distance from the origin.
Similarly, almost all of us have met vectors, either in mathematics of physics which are represented as a list of numbers.
The interpretation of vectors is largely as an object in a n-dimensional space with a direction and a magnitude.
Next, we all have encountered a matrix at some point in our lives. A calendar is a matrix with seven columns/rows where 
the columns/rows represent the days of a week. Matrices may have many interpretations and the most prevalent interpretation 
of a matrix of dimention $ m \times n $ is that of representing a linear transformation of vectors living in n-dimensional space into vectors living in a m-dimentional 
space.


# What are tensors?

Tensors are a generalisation of vectors and matrices. 
Vectors are 1st order tensors. 
If we stack more than one of these 1st order tensors, we get a 2nd order tensor or a matrix.
Stacking a few 2nd order tensors or matrices give us a third order tensor which is of interest 
to us in current discussion. Such 3rd order tensors are also called 3 way tensors.
