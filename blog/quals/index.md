###  Journey of wandering students

1. Get a **problem** handed down to them.
  
2. Struggle to reverse engineer the **motivation** from the problem. Start questioning their life choices. 

3. Frustrated, look for people who have already walked on **similar nails** before.

4. Learn about  **mysterious hammers** that others apparently used to nail the problem.   

5. With the various fast approaching  **Hammers showdown festivals**, they realize it is easier to
dismantle the mysterious hammers and retrofit to make them usable enough instead of trying to underestand
and learn the mysterious hammers used before.

6. Utilising the skills from some **familiar hammers** and some **slight of hand**, they forge a hammer
that they can use to barely nail the problem.

7. Making sure to decorate the **forged hammer** so they appear **mysterious** to the judges and others, they attend the hammer festivals.
