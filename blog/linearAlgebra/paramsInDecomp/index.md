Counting the number of free parameters in various matrix decompositions.
</b></p>


For my work on tensor decompositions for imputing traffic data, I needed to find the number of free parameters in low rank matrices and low rank tensors. In this note we will see the number of free parameters in various matrix decompositions. This not was made possible due to the materials present in Prof. Gilbert Strang's lectures on [ MITOCW @ Youtube | Lecture 18: Counting Parameters in SVD, LU, QR, Saddle Points ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaSL8yFgqig).
