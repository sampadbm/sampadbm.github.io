>It is interesting to note that Cisco has opened a 75-person software development center in India, but this reflects a smaller investment.[21] It parallels the effort of the Microsoft Windows NT development group in Hyderabad with roughly 20 programmers.[22] The sizes of these programming groups and the hardware manufacturing volumes in China indicate that the hardware side of the "information economy" may have a greater impact on gross national product (GNP) than the software side will.


>China has been more successful than India in pushing the network into higher education; however, neither has had primary or secondary school programs. One of the three basic goals of the Indian Action Plan is "IT for all by 2008," and India has ambitious plans for networking schools at all levels. For example, there is a mandate that "computers and Internet shall be made available in every school, polytechnic, college, university and public hospital in the country by the year 2003." Investment in distance education and financial incentives for computer purchase by students and teachers are also mandated, and these would lead to greater use of the Internet.
