Hello everyone, I am Sampad,¬† your TA for this semester for CSCI467. Welcome everyone to the most fascinating and impactful subject of the current decade and century. As part of our very first **CSCI467 (Machine Learning) discussion session**, I‚Äôd like to give you a **peek into the living ecosystem of machine learning**‚Äînot just the mathematics and code you‚Äôll soon be writing, but also:

*   ‚ú® **Interactive demos** you can play with right now,
*   üì∞ **News articles** and **historical stories** of how we got here,
*   üé• **Short videos** showing ML in action in the real world,
*   üîÆ **Predictions, ethical concerns, and safety debates** about where AI/ML is going next.

The goal is to understand ML not just as a technical toolkit, but as a **human endeavor shaped by people, labs, companies, and societal impacts**.

üìú History & Evolution
----------------------

Some themes we‚Äôll touch on:

*   The **Perceptron era** (Rosenblatt, 1950s), the **AI winters**, and the rebirth of neural nets.
*   Key labs and companies (Bell Labs, DARPA, Google Brain, DeepMind, OpenAI).
*   Pioneers like Marvin Minsky, Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Yann LeCun.
*   The rise of **big data, GPUs, and open-source ecosystems** (TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX).

* * *

üîÆ Future Directions & Ethical Questions
----------------------------------------

We‚Äôll also discuss:

*   Generative models (from NeRFs to world models).
*   ML in medicine, climate, and robotics.
*   Bias, fairness, interpretability, and responsible deployment.

* * *

üì¢ Your Task
------------

Before the session, I‚Äôd love for you to help **curate interesting content**: üëâ **Post/Reply¬† links here on Piazza** to demos, news articles, videos, or stories you‚Äôve come across that show ML being used in the real world‚Äîwhether historically, today, or in a speculative near future. Please describe in a few lines about the link you are posting to give context. For example, you can mention the year of the article in the link, or the people involved in the article/video/demo (if they are well known in the AI/ML community), the institution where the invention/discovery was carried out/took place, the ML subcategories - Supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, self-supervised, reinforcemen-learning, generative AI, AGI, etc. Due credit will be given for your contributions in the slides, and this way our first discussion becomes a collective exploration of ML‚Äôs past, present, and future. Looking forward to seeing what you all find! üöÄ ‚Äî _Sampad_

Synchron recently teamed up with Apple to release the first ever demo of mind-controlled iPads, leveraging Apple's accessibility features, and Synchron's brain-computer interface technology (BCIs). BCIs detect signals from blood vessels in the brain, which are decoded using machine learning algorithms that have been trained to detect motor intentions from neural signals. The outputs of this model are translated into actual iPad commands. These could be revolutionary for people with conditions such as Parkinson's or ALS.

https://krcrtv.com/news/local/pge-explains-how-ai-machine-learning-enhance-wildfire-prevention-efforts

This 2025 article covers how PG&E is using supervised ML to improve wildfire prevention in California. Their Fire Potential Index predicts fire risks hourly by analyzing massive historical datasets, plus real-time data from 1,600+ weather stations installed since 2017. The models also guide safety shutoffs and powerline safety measures to reduce fire damage.
