                       engaged to engineering,
                       memorable nights with computers,
                       trying to woo maths."

  text: "By three methods we may learn wisdom: 
        First, by reflection, which is noblest; 
        Second, by imitation, which is easiest; 
        and third by experience, which is the bitterest."
